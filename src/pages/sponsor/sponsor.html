Yukon</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We want to leave a positive, lasting
impression in the Yukon. We&rsquo;ll do that by hiring qualified
Yukoners and First Nations members wherever possible, and by
providing training, education and career development opportunities
for our employees. For example, we&rsquo;re partnering with Yukon
College to support local training and career development
opportunities.</P><BR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Partnering with First Nations</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Whitehorse-based project team is
working closely with First Nations and community partners to design a
socially and environmentally responsible project. A Collaboration
Agreement between the Tr&rsquo;ond&euml;k Hw&euml;ch&rsquo;in and
Goldcorp represents an important milestone towards building a
long-term relationship with local First Nations and delivering
economic opportunities at each stage of the project.</P><BR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Treating the environment with care</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The land of the Yukon is unique, and
requires special care by those working on it &ndash; at every stage
of the mining life cycle. Our project will be designed in accordance
with Newmont Goldcorp&rsquo;s environmental standards, which are
designed to protect the environment and prevent &ndash; or otherwise
minimize, mitigate and remediate &ndash; those impacts. A wildlife
monitoring program is being developed to ensure our operations don&rsquo;t
harm wildlife such as bears, moose and caribou, and our Project will
adhere to the International Cyanide Management Code.</P><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm "><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
Project contains a substantial oxide resource</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and will be a conventional, open pit and heap leach mine with no
tailings. Site infrastructure features four open pits with one rock
storage facility.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm "><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mine
life includes 2.5 years of construction, 8-10 years of operational
mine life, and 10-11 years of closure, with progressive reclamation
beginning early in the operational mine life.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm "><FONT COLOR="#000000">Conceptual
design indicates approximately 60 million tonnes of mined ore over
the mine life, producing over 2.5 M oz au and expected to grow as
near pit exploration continues. </FONT>

approximately 214 km long. The NAR follows existing public roads for
over 80% of the route and will required approximately 37 km of new
road construction, along with various upgrades along portions of the
remainder of the route. </FONT>
